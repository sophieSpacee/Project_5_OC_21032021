# Orinoco -  Projet 5 of Web Developper course with OpenClassrooms

## Project goals:

This project is part of my course to become a full stack developer. I was provided with a backend repository, the company's logo and a few pages of functional specifications and I had to code the frontend of the ecommerce website. I developed it using pure Javascript and Bootstrap. I did not have any mock up, so I had to work on design as well as frontend development. 

## Project walkthrough:

For this project, I used API calls to get products images and information from a database and I displayed it on a website I created.

  Users can click on a product to get more information about it.  
  From this page, they can personalize it and add it to their cart.

On the cart page, users can choose to delete an item.  
They can also fill out a form to place an order.   
One the form is submitted, they get redirected to a confirmation page that displays their order ID.
