# Orinoco -  Projet 5 of Web Developper course with OpenClassrooms


## To start this project :

1. With your terminal, go to Backend folder
2. Write 'git submodule update --init' to pull backend repository
3. From within the Backend folder, run `npm install` to install node
4. Write `node server` to run the server. 
5. Open index.html to test the application


## Backend Repository
If you want, you can directly clone the backend repository from this address : 
https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/JWDP5.git

## Project goals:

This project is part of my course to become a full stack developer. I was provided with a backend repository, the company's logo and a few pages of functional specifications and I had to code the frontend of the ecommerce website. I developed it using pure Javascript and Bootstrap. I did not have any mock up, so I had to work on design as well as frontend development.
